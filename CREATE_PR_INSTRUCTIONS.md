# How to Create the Pull Request

Since I encountered permission issues when trying to push to the remote repository, you'll need to create the pull request manually. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

## Step 1: Push Your Branch to Remote Repository

First, push the feature branch to GitHub:

```bash
# Push the feature branch
git push -u origin feature/tenant-flags-data-export-docker-ws-security
```

If you encounter permission issues, you may need to:
1. Check your GitHub permissions for the repository
2. Ensure you're using the correct GitHub account
3. Contact the repository maintainer for push permissions

## Step 2: Create Pull Request on GitHub

Once the branch is pushed, create a pull request:

### Option A: Via GitHub Web UI
1. Go to: https://github.com/SubStream-Protocol/SubStream-Protocol-Backend
2. Click on "Pull Requests" tab
3. Click "New pull request"
4. Select your branch: `feature/tenant-flags-data-export-docker-ws-security`
5. Click "Create pull request"

### Option B: Via GitHub CLI
```bash
gh pr create --title "feat: Implement four critical features - tenant flags, data export, Docker K8s, and WebSocket rate limiting" --body-file PR_TEMPLATE.md
```

## Step 3: Fill in Pull Request Details

Use the following information for the PR:

### Title:
```
feat: Implement four critical features - tenant flags, data export, Docker K8s, and WebSocket rate limiting
```

### Description:
Copy the content from `PR_TEMPLATE.md` file I created for you. It contains:
- Comprehensive feature descriptions
- Testing information
- Performance impact
- Security considerations
- Breaking changes
- Migration requirements
- Deployment instructions
- Acceptance criteria validation

### Labels:
- `architecture`
- `security`
- `performance`
- `feature`
- `docker`
- `kubernetes`

### Reviewers:
- Add appropriate team members or maintainers

### Assignees:
- Assign to yourself or relevant team members

## Step 4: Run Pre-merge Checks

Before merging, ensure these checks pass:

### Automated Checks:
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage meets requirements
- [ ] Security scans pass
- [ ] Docker build succeeds

### Manual Checks:
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Feature initialization works: `node scripts/initializeFeatures.js`
- [ ] Implementation verification passes: `node scripts/verifyImplementation.js`
- [ ] Local development environment works
- [ ] Docker container runs correctly

## Step 5: Review Process

### Code Review Checklist:
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Security best practices implemented
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Tests are thorough

### Functional Review:
- [ ] Feature flags work correctly
- [ ] Data export functions properly
- [ ] WebSocket rate limiting is effective
- [ ] Docker deployment works
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment works

## Step 6: Merge Strategy

### Recommended Merge Strategy:
- **Squash and merge** to keep commit history clean
- Ensure PR description is comprehensive for future reference
- Delete feature branch after merge

### Alternative:
- **Create merge commit** if you want to preserve the development history

## Step 7: Post-Merge Actions

After the PR is merged:

### Database Migration:
```bash
# Deploy to staging first
npm run migrate

# Verify migration success
npm run migrate:list
```

### Feature Initialization:
```bash
# Initialize features for existing tenants
node scripts/initializeFeatures.js

# Verify implementation
node scripts/verifyImplementation.js
```

### Deployment:
```bash
# Build and deploy Docker image
docker build -t substream-backend:latest .
docker push your-registry/substream-backend:latest

# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/
kubectl rollout status deployment/substream-backend -n substream
```

### Monitoring:
- Set up monitoring for new metrics
- Configure alerts for rate limiting violations
- Monitor feature flag performance
- Track data export job queue health

## Step 8: Documentation Updates

After deployment:
- Update API documentation
- Update user guides
- Update deployment guides
- Create feature announcements
- Update internal documentation

## Troubleshooting

### If Push Fails:
1. Check GitHub permissions
2. Verify remote URL: `git remote -v`
3. Ensure you're on correct branch: `git branch`
4. Try force push if needed: `git push --force-with-lease`

### If PR Creation Fails:
1. Ensure branch is pushed to remote
2. Check for merge conflicts
3. Verify branch is up to date with main
4. Contact repository maintainers

### If Tests Fail:
1. Check environment variables
2. Verify Redis is running
3. Check database connection
4. Review test logs for specific errors

## Quick Commands Summary
