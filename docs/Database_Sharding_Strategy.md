# Database Sharding Strategy RFC

## RFC: Database Horizontal Sharding Strategy for SubStream Protocol

**Author:** SubStream Protocol Team  
**Status:** Draft  
**Created:** March 2026  
**Target:** Multi-Master Database Architecture  

## Executive Summary

This RFC outlines a comprehensive horizontal sharding strategy for the SubStream Protocol backend to support long-term scalability. After analyzing the current SQLite-based architecture and projected growth patterns, we recommend **creator_id-based sharding** as the primary strategy, with geo-region as a secondary consideration for future optimization.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Database Schema Overview
The current implementation uses SQLite with the following core entities:

- **creators** - Creator profiles and metadata
- **videos** - Video content and metadata  
- **subscriptions** - User subscription relationships
- **creator_audit_logs** - Audit trail for creator actions
- **comments** - User comments on content
- **creator_settings** - Creator-specific configuration
- **transcoding_results** - Video processing results
- **coop_splits** - Revenue sharing configurations

### Current Limitations
- Single SQLite database file limits concurrent writes
- No horizontal scaling capability
- Geographic latency issues for global user base
- Single point of failure
- Limited to local file system storage

## Sharding Strategy Analysis

### Option 1: Creator ID-Based Sharding (RECOMMENDED)

**Advantages:**
- **Data Locality**: All creator-related data (videos, subscriptions, comments, audit logs) resides on the same shard
- **Query Performance**: Most queries are creator-scoped, minimizing cross-shard joins
- **Simple Migration Path**: Clear sharding key exists in all relevant tables
- **Load Distribution**: Natural distribution based on creator activity patterns
- **Business Logic Alignment**: Maps directly to the creator-centric business model

**Disadvantages:**
- Popular creators may create "hot shards"
- Requires rebalancing mechanisms for creator growth

**Implementation:**
```sql
-- Sharding key: creator_id
-- Shard mapping: hash(creator_id) % shard_count

-- Example shard assignment:
-- Shard 0: creators with hash(creator_id) % 8 = 0
-- Shard 1: creators with hash(creator_id) % 8 = 1
-- ...
-- Shard 7: creators with hash(creator_id) % 8 = 7
```

### Option 2: Geographic Region-Based Sharding

**Advantages:**
- **Latency Optimization**: Data stored closer to users
- **Compliance**: Data residency requirements
- **Regional Failover**: Natural disaster recovery boundaries

**Disadvantages:**
- **Cross-Region Queries**: Creator content accessed globally requires cross-shard queries
- **Complex Migration**: Geographic data movement is expensive
- **Uneven Distribution**: Population density creates imbalanced loads
- **Business Logic Mismatch**: Creators are global, not regional

**Implementation:**
```sql
-- Sharding key: geo_region (derived from user IP or self-reported)
-- Shard mapping: direct mapping to geographic regions

-- Example shard assignment:
-- Shard 0: North America
-- Shard 1: Europe  
-- Shard 2: Asia Pacific
-- Shard 3: Other regions
```

## Recommended Strategy: Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Creator ID-Based Sharding (Primary)
- Implement consistent hashing on creator_id
- Start with 8 shards, expandable to 32+
- Use PostgreSQL for each shard

### Phase 2: Geographic Optimization (Secondary)

- Implement write routing to primary region
- Add read replicas for latency optimization

### Software Architecture Changes

#### 1. Database Abstraction Layer

```javascript
// New: ShardAwareDatabaseClient
class ShardAwareDatabaseClient {
  constructor(shardConfig) {
    this.shardRouter = new ShardRouter(shardConfig);
    this.connectionPools = this.initializePools(shardConfig);
  }

  async query(creatorId, sql, params) {
    const shardId = this.shardRouter.getShard(creatorId);
    const pool = this.connectionPools[shardId];
    return pool.query(sql, params);
  }

  async transaction(creatorId, callback) {
    const shardId = this.shardRouter.getShard(creatorId);
    const pool = this.connectionPools[shardId];
    return pool.transaction(callback);
  }
}
```

#### 2. Shard Router Service

```javascript
class ShardRouter {
  constructor(shardCount) {
    this.shardCount = shardCount;
    this.ring = new ConsistentHashRing(shardCount);
    this.healthChecker = new ShardHealthChecker();
  }

  getShard(creatorId) {
    return this.ring.getShard(creatorId);
  }

  async getHealthyShard(creatorId) {
    const primaryShard = this.getShard(creatorId);
    if (await this.healthChecker.isHealthy(primaryShard)) {
      return primaryShard;
    }
    return this.getFailoverShard(primaryShard);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Migration Strategy

**Phase 1: Dual-Write Period (4 weeks)**
- Continue writing to SQLite
- Begin writing to PostgreSQL shards
- Validate data consistency

**Phase 2: Read Migration (2 weeks)**
- Route reads to PostgreSQL shards
- Maintain SQLite as backup
- Performance validation

**Phase 3: Cutover (1 week)**
- Final data synchronization
- Switch all traffic to shards
- Decommission SQLite

#### 4. Service Updates Required

**AppDatabase Class Modifications:**
- Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL client
- Add shard-aware query methods
- Implement cross-shard transaction handling

**API Layer Changes:**
- Add creator_id to all relevant requests
- Implement shard routing middleware
- Update error handling for shard failures

**Background Services:**
- Video processing worker updates
- Subscription expiry checker modifications
- Analytics service shard aggregation

### Multi-Master Architecture Preparation

#### Master-Master Replication Setup

**Configuration:**
- Primary shards in different geographic regions
- Logical replication using PostgreSQL's built-in features
- Conflict resolution based on timestamp and creator_id

**Conflict Resolution Strategy:**
```sql
-- Example: Last-write-wins with creator_id tie-breaker
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  creator_id TEXT,
  wallet_address TEXT,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (creator_id, wallet_address)
) WITH (PRIMARY_KEY_USING_INDEX = true);

-- Replication conflict resolution
ALTER TABLE subscriptions 
  REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
```

#### Global Transaction Coordination

**Two-Phase Commit Implementation:**
- Coordinator service for cross-shard transactions
- Timeout and rollback mechanisms
- Compensation transaction patterns
