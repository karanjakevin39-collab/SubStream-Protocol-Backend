## Right to be Forgotten (Data Deletion)

### User-Initiated Deletion

**Eligibility:** Any user may request deletion of their personal data at any time

**Process:**
1. User submits deletion request via API endpoint or support ticket
2. System verifies user identity (wallet signature or authentication)
3. PII scrubbing process is initiated within 24 hours
4. User receives confirmation of completion
5. Affected merchants receive webhook notification

**Data Deleted:**
- Email addresses
- IP addresses
- User names
- Profile information
- Device fingerprints
- Any other directly identifying information

**Data Preserved (Anonymized):**
- Financial records (with anonymized user identity)
- Audit logs (with anonymized user identity)
- System records required for compliance

### Automated Retention Policy

**Trigger:** 3 years of account inactivity

**Process:**
1. Automated job runs weekly to identify inactive users
2. PII scrubbing is performed automatically
3. Audit log entry is created
4. No notification is sent (user is inactive)

**Scope:** All PII across database, Redis cache, and analytics warehouse

## Data Deletion Process

### Technical Implementation

**Cryptographic Hashing:**
- Algorithm: SHA-256 with HMAC
- Salt: Environment-specific secure salt (32 bytes)
- Format: `prefix_hash` for debugging, irreversible for security

**Wallet Address Anonymization:**
- Original: `GD5DQ6ZQZKQZQZQZQZQZQZQZQZQZQZQZQZQZQZQZQZQZQZQZQ`
- Anonymized: `GD5DQ6ZQZ_abc123def456...` (first 8 chars + hash)

**Email Anonymization:**
- Original: `user@example.com`
- Anonymized: `scrubbed_[hash]@anon.example.com`

**IP Address Anonymization:**
- Original: `192.168.1.100`
- Anonymized: `scrubbed_[hash]`

### Database Tables Scrubbed

1. **subscriptions** - user_email, wallet_address
2. **creator_audit_logs** - ip_address
3. **api_key_audit_logs** - ip_address
4. **data_export_tracking** - requester_email
5. **privacy_preferences** - share_email_with_merchants
6. **comments** - user_address
7. **leaderboard_entries** - fan_address
8. **social_tokens** - user_address
9. **activitypub_engagements** - fan_address

### Cache Scrubbing

**Redis Keys Scrubbed:**
- `user:{walletAddress}:*`
- `profile:{walletAddress}:*`
- `subscription:{walletAddress}:*`
- `creator:{walletAddress}:*`
- `session:{walletAddress}:*`
- `cache:{walletAddress}:*`

### Analytics Warehouse

**Data Anonymized:**
- User identifiers replaced with hashed values
- IP addresses removed or hashed
- Email addresses removed or hashed
- Device fingerprints removed

## Merchant Notifications

### Webhook Payload

When a user invokes their right to be forgotten, affected merchants receive a webhook notification:

```json
{
  "event": "user.forget",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-26T14:00:00Z",
  "scrub_id": "uuid-v4",
  "data": {
    "anonymized_wallet_address": "GD5DQ6ZQZ_abc123...",
    "reason": "user_request",
    "scrubbed_at": "2026-04-26T14:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Purpose:** Inform merchants that user data has been deleted so they can update their own records

**Timing:** Within 24 hours of deletion request

**Security:** Webhooks signed with merchant's secret

## Audit Trail

All deletion operations are logged with:

- Scrub operation ID (UUID)
- Original wallet address (hashed)
- Anonymized wallet address
- Reason for deletion
- Timestamp
- Tables affected
- Rows modified
- Operator (user/admin/system)
- Success/failure status

**Retention:** Audit logs retained for 5 years for compliance

## Verification

Users can verify their data has been deleted by:

1. Calling the verification endpoint with their wallet address
2. Receiving confirmation of scrubbing status
3. Reviewing which tables were affected

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/compliance/forget/:walletAddress/status`

## Data Export (Right to Data Portability)

Users may request a copy of their data before deletion:

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/compliance/export`

**Data Included:**
- Subscriptions
- Comments
- Audit logs (last 100 entries)
- Privacy preferences

**Format:** JSON

**Delivery:** Secure download link (expires in 7 days)
