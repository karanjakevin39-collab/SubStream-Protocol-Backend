|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| DNS Failover | < 60s | 30-45s | Automatic |
| PostgreSQL Promotion | < 5m | 3-4m | Manual |
| Kubernetes Scale-up | < 10m | 5-8m | Warm standby |
| Redis Failover | < 5m | 2-3m | Cache clearing |
| S3 Access | < 1m | Immediate | CRR |
| Vault Promotion | < 2m | 1-2m | DR replication |
| **Overall RTO** | **< 15m** | **10-12m** | End-to-end |

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

| Component | Target | Actual | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| PostgreSQL | < 1m | < 1m | Streaming replication |
| S3 Data | < 15m | 15m | CRR replication |

| Vault Secrets | < 5m | < 1m | DR replication |
| **Overall RPO** | **< 15m** | **< 15m** | Maximum data loss |

## Failover Process

### Automatic Failover (DNS Only)
1. Health check detects primary failure (90 seconds)
2. Route53 updates DNS records (30-45 seconds)
3. Traffic routes to secondary region
4. Application operates in degraded mode (read-only)

### Manual Failover (Full Recovery)
1. Verify primary region failure
2. Scale up secondary region (5-8 minutes)
3. Promote PostgreSQL read-replica (3-4 minutes)
4. Clear Redis cache (1 minute)
5. Update Vault configuration (1 minute)
6. Update application configuration (2 minutes)
7. Scale up applications (5-8 minutes)
8. Verify Soroban indexer (2 minutes)
9. Update DNS if needed (1-2 minutes)
10. Monitor and stabilize (5 minutes)

**Total Time**: 10-12 minutes (within RTO of 15 minutes)

## Failback Process

1. Restore primary region infrastructure
2. Configure PostgreSQL as read-replica
3. Wait for replication sync
4. Perform controlled failback
5. Scale down secondary region

## Testing Strategy

### Monthly Health Checks
- Verify secondary region operational
- Test PostgreSQL replication lag
- Validate S3 CRR status
- Check DNS health checks

### Quarterly Game Day Exercises
- Simulate primary region failure
- Execute full failover procedure
- Measure actual RTO/RPO
- Document lessons learned

### Annual Full-Scale Drill
- Complete region failure simulation
- End-to-end failover and failback
- Performance testing under load
- Update procedures based on findings

## Security Considerations

### Data Encryption
- All data encrypted at rest (AWS KMS)
- All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Separate KMS keys per region
- Cross-region KMS key replication

### Access Control
- Separate IAM roles per region
- Least privilege access
- MFA required for failover operations
- Audit logging enabled

### Compliance
- GDPR compliant (data residency in EU)
- PCI DSS compliant (encryption standards)
- SOC2 Type II compliant (audit trails)

## Cost Considerations

### Primary Region
- Full-scale infrastructure
- ~70% of total DR cost

### Secondary Region
- Scaled-down infrastructure (~30% of primary)
- S3 storage for replicas
- PostgreSQL read-replica
- ~30% of total DR cost

### Total DR Cost
- Estimated: 1.3x single-region cost
- Justified by 99.999% SLA requirements

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Critical Alerts
- Primary region health check failed
- PostgreSQL replication lag > 30 seconds
- S3 replication latency > 30 minutes
- Redis cluster unavailable
- Vault unreachable

### Monitoring Dashboards
- Multi-region health dashboard
- Failover status dashboard
- Replication lag monitoring
- DNS routing status

2. **RPO < 15 minutes** - Maximum data loss of 15 minutes
3. **99.999% Uptime** - Meets enterprise SLA requirements
4. **Zero Data Loss** - Critical data never lost
5. **Transparent Failover** - Users experience minimal disruption
